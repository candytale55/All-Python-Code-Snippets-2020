# Sal-s-Shipping-Python

Will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way to ship that package using Salâ€™s Shippers rates: - Ground shipping (small flat rate + rate based on weight). - Premium ground shipping (flat charge and no charge for weight). - Drone shipping (no flat charge but the rate based on weight is higher)
