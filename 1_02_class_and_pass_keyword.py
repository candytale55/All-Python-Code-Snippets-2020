# A class is a template for a data type. It describes the kinds of information that class will hold and how a programmer will interact with that data.

#  PEP 8 Style Guide for Python Code recommends capitalizing the names of classes to make them easier to identify.

class CoolClass:
  pass
# the pass keyword in Python to indicate that the body of the class was intentionally left blank so we donâ€™t cause an IndentationError. 

class Facade:
  pass
