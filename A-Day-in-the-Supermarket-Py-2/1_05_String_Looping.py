## strings are like lists with characters as elements. You can loop through strings the same way you loop through lists

for letter in "Codecademy":
  print letter
    
# Empty lines to make the output pretty
print
print

word = "Programming is fun!"

for letter in word:
  # Only print out the letter i
  if letter == "i":
    print letter
