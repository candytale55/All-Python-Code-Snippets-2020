# The for loop in terms of how it relates to lists: It allow us to iterate through all of the elements 
# in a list from the left-most (or zeroth element) to the right-most element.

#  be careful to avoid using the word list as a variable, since thatâ€™s a reserved word



names = ["Adam","Alex","Mariah","Martine","Columbus"]

for name in names:
  print name


# Output
"""
Adam
Alex
Mariah
