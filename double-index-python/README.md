# double_index (Python)

## General info
Function double_index takes two parameters: a list (lst) and a single number (index). It should return a new list where all elements are the same as in lst except for the element at index. The element at index should be double the value of the element at index of the original lst.  

For example, double_index([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) should return [1,2,6,4] because the element at index 2 has been doubled.

If index is not a valid index, the function should return the original list.
