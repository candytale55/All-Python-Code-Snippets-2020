# same_values_Py_3
same_values() takes two lists of numbers. The function should return a list where the values were equal in lst1 and lst2. 

## Description

In **_same_values_equal_lists.py_**  the lists of numbers that it takes as parameter must be of equal size. The function _same_values()_ returns a list of the INDEXES (not the values themselves) where the values were equal in lst1 and lst2. The function _same_values_numbers()_ returns the values that matched, not the indexes.

#### To-do list:
* Do a function that can take lists of unequal length. 
* Use list comprehension

## Technologies
* Python 3

## Setup
NA - It's only coding examples, there's no setup.

## Status
Project is: _finished_ (technically) - but may come back and do the TO-DOs at some point.
