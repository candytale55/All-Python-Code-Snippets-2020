# remove_middle

## General info
Create a function named remove_middle which has three parameters (lst, start, end). The function should return a list where all elements in lst with an index between start and end (inclusive) have been removed.     

For example remove_middle([4, 8 , 15, 16, 23, 42], 1, 3) should return [4, 23, 42] because elements at indices 1, 2, and 3 have been removed.
