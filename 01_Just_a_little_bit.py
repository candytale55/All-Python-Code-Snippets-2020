"""
Your computer is built of electronics that create low and high voltages. If a voltage is high, it’s read as a 1, and a 0 if it’s low. 

Then you have logic gates that are capable of sending an output signal based on the input signals they get. These logic gates make up the ability to do a lot of computation.

0s and 1s send all kinds of signals in all kinds of combinations, and as a result, we have modern computing as we know it!
