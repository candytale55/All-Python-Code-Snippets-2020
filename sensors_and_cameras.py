# A dictionary is an unordered set of key: value pairs. 


# EXAMPLES: 
# You have a dictionary of temperature sensors in your house and what temperatures they read. Youâ€™ve just added a sensor to your "pantry", and it reads 22 degrees.

sensors =  {"living room": 21, "kitchen": 23, "bedroom": 20, "pantry": 22}

# The dictionary num_cameras represents the number of cameras in each area around your house.
num_cameras = {"backyard": 6,  "garage": 2, "driveway": 1}

print(sensors)
# {'living room': 21, 'kitchen': 23, 'bedroom': 20, 'pantry': 22}

print(num_cameras)
# {'backyard': 6, 'garage': 2, 'driveway': 1}
