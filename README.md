# unique_english_letters_Py_3
unique_english_letters takes a string word as a parameter. The function should return the total number of unique letters in the string. Uppercase and lowercase letters should be counted as different letters. The list of every uppercase and lower case letter in the English alphabet is in a string "letters".

## General info
The purpose of the project is just personal learning. I may revisit this code to find different solutions or to apply it under other context. 

## Description
The function iterates through _word_, and compares if the letter is already in the list _unique_ (that starts as an empty list). If it hasn't been added to unique before, it appends it. The function returns the length of _unique_. 

#### TO-DOs
* The problem said: _"Loop through the list of English letters and check to see if each letter is included in word."_ I did it differently and didn't get to use the list _letters_,  and it worked and it seems a better solution, but maybe I should try to do it as intended - just for fun. 

## Technologies
* Python 3

## Setup
NA - It's only coding examples, there's no setup.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_, _finished_, - may come back and improve it, or not.
