# Python Practice Evolution (2019‚Äì2023)

This repository is an archive of Python practice exercises I've completed between 2019 and 2023. It includes solutions and experiments from tutorials, coding platforms, and personal challenges ‚Äî mainly from Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, and others I explored independently.

Over the years, this repo has grown organically as I learned more about Python and programming in general. You‚Äôll find simple early scripts, object-oriented exercises, command-line tools, and more.

## üìÅ Structure

Each folder represents a separate exercise or mini-project. Some have meaningful names (e.g., `rock-paper-scissors`), while others are more generic (e.g., `exercises-with-classes`) due to their origin in course work.

Most folders include their own `README.md`, but note:
- Early ones are minimal or include personal notes.
- Later ones may include objectives, external links, tools used, and clearer documentation.

> üö® Note: The folders are **not ordered chronologically** ‚Äî GitHub displays them alphabetically. This repo is meant as a **learning archive**, not a portfolio showcase.

## üß† Why Keep This?

- To reflect my learning progression over time.
- As a reference for myself and others working through similar material.
- To show consistency and dedication in learning Python.

## üß© Technologies & Topics

Throughout this repo you‚Äôll find code that explores:
- Basic syntax, conditionals, loops
- Functions and recursion
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Modules and file handling
- Simple games and command-line programs
- Code inspired by learning platforms

## ‚ö†Ô∏è This Is Not a Polished Portfolio

If you're looking for more production-grade code or larger, structured apps, check out my main Python portfolio repo (coming soon!).
