# Area_Calculator_Python_2


## General info
This project is a calculator that can compute the area of Circles and Triangles.  

## Features
The program will: 
* Prompt the user to select a shape. 
* Calculate the area of that shape. 
* Print the area of that shape to the user.

To-do list:
* It would be better make the accepted inputs more flexible (accept lowercase letters for example).
* It would be nice to add other methods to get the triangle areas like here:  http://es.onlinemschool.com/math/assistance/figures_area/triangle/
