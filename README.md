# ASCII_Block_Letters_PY

## General info
The file initials.py displays the initials of your name in block letters (ASCII art) using multiple print() statements. There's the basic exercise solution and my solution lists containing the letters and using a for loop to print them. 
The file alphabet.py will contain the letters, numbers and symbols in list form.
