# make_spoonerism_Py_3
function make_spoonerism() takes two strings as parameters named _word1_ and _word2_. Spoonerism switch the first letters of each word and returns the two new words as a single string separated by a space.

A Spoonerism is an error in speech when the first syllables of two words are switched. For example, a Spoonerism is made when someone says “Belly Jeans” instead of “Jelly Beans”.

#### To-Do
* Finding the first syllable of a word is difficult, so the function right now only switches the first letters of each word. Try doing it with whole syllables. 

## Technologies
* Python 3
