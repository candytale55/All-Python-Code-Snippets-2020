# larger_sum_Py_3
larger_sum() takes two lists of numbers as parameters named lst1 and lst2. It returns the list whose elements sum to the greater number. If the sum of the elements of each list are equal, it returns lst1.


## General info
The purpose of the project is just personal learning. I may revisit this code to find different solutions or to apply it under other context. 

## Features
In file **_larger_sum_extra_basic.js_** : larger_sum() loops through each list separately and adds to variables sum1 and sum2. After looping is done it, compares the two sums in an if statement and return the correct list. 

#### To-do list:
* The excersise solution is too basic. It should be possible to do it with builtin methods and/or removing variables sum1 and sum2 = working directly with the lists.


## Technologies
* Python 3

## Setup
NA - It's only coding examples, there's no setup.

## Status
Project is: technically _finished_, - may come back and improve it, or not.
