# substring_between_letters_Py_3
substring_between_letters takes a string named _word_, a single character named _start_, and another character named _end_. This function should return the substring between the first occurrence of _start_ and _end_ in word. If _start_ or _end_ are not in _word_, the function should return _word_.  For example, substring_between_letters("apple", "p", "e") should return "pl".

## General info
The purpose of the project is just personal learning. I may revisit this code to find different solutions or to apply it under other context. 

#### To-do list:
* Try doing it with index() instead of find()
* The solution given to this exercise was slightly different. Try it removing the else (hint: >-1 instead of == -1)


## Technologies
* Python 3

## Setup
NA - It's only coding examples, there's no setup.

## Status
Project is: _finished_, - may come back and improve it, or not.
