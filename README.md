# Battleship_Py_2
Build a simplified, one-player version of the classic board game Battleship with Python 2. There will be a single ship hidden in a random location on a 5x5 grid. The player will have 10 guesses to try to sink the ship. Codecademy practice project.

## General info
The purpose of the project is just personal learning. 

## Description

#### **Creating the board:**
* A variable _board_ is set it equal to an empty list. Using the built-in _range()_ Python function, looping 5 times will generate the board, which will be a 5 x 5 grid of all "O"s, for “ocean.”

* Function **_print_board_** takes a single argument, _board_in_. It prints the board out like a grid with each row on its own line using a for loop to iterates through each row in board and print it to the screen.


#### To-do list:
* Wow improvement to be done 1
* Wow improvement to be done 2
