# odd_indices_Py
Function odd_indices() takes one parameter named lst. The function should create a new empty list and add every element from lst that has an odd index. The function should then return this new list.   For example, odd_indices([4, 3, 7, 10, 11, -2]) should return the list [3, 10, -2].
