class Facade:
  pass

# Make a Facade instance and save it to the variable facade_1.
facade_1 = Facade()




# A class must be instantiated = we must create an instance of the class, to breathe life into the schematic.
# Instantiating a class looks a lot like calling a function:  cool_instance = CoolClass()

# we created an object by adding parentheses to the name of the class. We then assigned that new instance to the variable cool_instance 
# for safe-keeping so we can access our instance of CoolClass at a later time.
