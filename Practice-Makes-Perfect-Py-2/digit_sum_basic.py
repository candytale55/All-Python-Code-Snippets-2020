# function digit_sum takes a positive integer n as input and returns the sum of all that numberâ€™s digits. 
# For example: digit_sum(1234) should return 10 which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4. (Assume that the number you are given will always be positive.)



# 1st Failed attempt:
"""
def digit_sum(n):
  num_sum = 0
  for digit in n: 
    num_sum += digit
  return num_sum


print digit_sum(1234)

# Traceback error:

# Solution: convert the integer to a string with str(), iterate over it, and turn the substrings back into integers with int() to do the addition.


def digit_sum(n):
  num_sum = 0
  for digit in str(n): 
    num_sum += int(digit)
  return num_sum


print digit_sum(1234) # 10
