# count_x_in_word_Py_3
These functions take a string named _word_ and a single or multi character named _x_  as parameters. The function should return the number of times _x_ appears in _word_.

## Description
The purpose of the project is just personal learning. 

**_count_char_x_**  returns the number of times _x_ appears in _word_ and works just with a single character named _x_.

**_count_multi_char_x_** returns the number of times x appears in _word_ and it works when x is multiple characters long.


#### To-do list:
* Do _count_char_x_ only works with a single character x? Haven't test it, must check it out. 
* For searching both uppercase/lowercase
* Symbols and spaces
