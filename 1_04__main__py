class Facade:
  pass

facade_1 = Facade()

facade_1_type = type(facade_1)
print(facade_1_type)
# <class '__main__.Facade'>

# In Python __main__ means “this current file that we’re running” and so one could read the output from type() to mean “_the class 
# Facade that was defined here, in the script you’re currently running._”


# A class instance is also called an _object_. 
# The pattern of defining classes and creating objects to represent the responsibilities of a program is known as Object Oriented Programming or OOP.

# Instantiation takes a class and turns it into an object, the type() function does the opposite of that. 
# When called with an object, it returns the class that the object is an instance of.
