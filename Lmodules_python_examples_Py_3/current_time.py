# One common library that comes as part of the Python Standard Library is datetime. datetime helps you work with dates and times in Python.

# Datetime is both the name of the library and the name of the object that you are importing.



from datetime import datetime

current_time = datetime.now()
print(current_time)



# Python allows us to package code into files or sets of files called modules.

# A module is a collection of Python declarations intended broadly to be used as a tool. Modules are also often referred to as “libraries” or “packages” — a package is really a directory that holds a collection of modules.

# from module_name import object_name

# A library will include a lot of code that you don’t need that may slow down your program or conflict with existing code. Because of this, it makes sense to only import what you need.
