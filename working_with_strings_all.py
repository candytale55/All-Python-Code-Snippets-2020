#  "letter in word" is a boolean expression that is True if the string letter is in the string word. Here are some examples. It not only works with letters, but with entire strings as well.

print("melon" in "watermelon") # True
print("melon" in "butterfly")  # False



# Write a function called contains that takes two arguments, big_string and little_string and returns True if big_string contains little_string. For example contains("watermelon", "melon") should return True and contains("watermelon", "berry") should return False.
