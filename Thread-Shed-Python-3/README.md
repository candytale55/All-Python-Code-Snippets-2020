# Thread_Shed_Python_3
Practice with python string methods for cleaning a string. "Youâ€™ve been hired as a cashier in Thread Shed shop. which has an out-dated register system and stores all of the transaction information in one string called daily_sales."

## General info
The purpose of the project is just personal learning.

## Description
Thread Shed keeps its register of all of the transaction information in one long awful string called daily_sales. For each transaction, the name of the customer, amount spent, types of thread purchased, and the date of sale is recorded in this same string. 

The task is to iterate through the string and clean up each transaction and store all the information in easier to access lists and then get the following:
* Collect the individual data points for each transaction in thres separate lists: customers, sales, and thread_sold
* To know how much money the shop did in one day (_total_sales_).
* To know how many of each color was sold (using function _color_count(color)_).
* Count the number of sales for each color using a _for_ loop and _.format()_.

## Technologies
* Python 3

## Setup
