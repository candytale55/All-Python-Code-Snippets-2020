# A basic class consists only of the class keyword, the name of the class, and the class from which the new class inherits in parentheses.  
# For now, our classes will inherit from the _object_ class. 

# This gives them the powers and abilities of a Python object. By convention, user-defined Python class names start with a capital letter.


class NewClass(object):
  # Class magic here
  pass



class Animal(object):
  pass

# pass doesn’t do anything, but it’s useful as a placeholder in areas of your code where Python expects an expression.
