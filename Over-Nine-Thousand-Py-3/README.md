# over_nine_thousand_Py_3
over_nine_thousand() takes a list of numbers named lst as a parameter. 

It sums the elements of the list until the sum is greater than 9000. When this happens, the function should return the sum. 

If the sum of all of the elements is never greater than 9000, the function should return total sum of all the elements. 

If the list is empty, the function should return 0. 

For example, if lst was [8000, 900, 120, 5000], then the function should return 9020.
