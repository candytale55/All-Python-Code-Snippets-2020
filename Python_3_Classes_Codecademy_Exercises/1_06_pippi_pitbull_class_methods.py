# We define methods similarly to functions, except that they are indented to be part of the class.

class Dog:
  dog_time_dilation = 7
 
  def time_explanation(self):
    print("Dogs experience {} years for every 1 human year.".format(self.dog_time_dilation))
 
 
pipi_pitbull = Dog()
pipi_pitbull.time_explanation()
# Prints "Dogs experience 7 years for every 1 human year."


# Dog class with a time_explanation method that takes one argument, 
# self, which refers to the object calling the function. 
# We created a Dog named pipi_pitbull and called the .time_explanation() method on our new object for Pipi.

# We didnâ€™t pass any arguments when we called .time_explanation(), but were able to refer to self in the function body. 
# When you call a method it automatically passes the object calling the method as the first argument.

class Rules:
  def washing_brushes(self):
    return "Point bristles towards the basin while washing your brushes."


my_rules = Rules()
print(my_rules.washing_brushes())
# Point bristles towards the basin while washing your brushes.

# Methods are functions that are defined as part of a class. 
# The first argument in a method is always the object that is calling the method. 
# Convention recommends that we name this first argument self. Methods always have at least this one argument.
