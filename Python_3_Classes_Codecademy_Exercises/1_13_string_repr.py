# One of the first things we learn as programmers is how to print out information that we need for debugging. 
# When we print out an object we get a default representation that seems fairly useless.

class Employee1():
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
 
argus = Employee1("Argus Filch")
print(argus)
# prints "<__main__.Employee object at 0x104e88390>" 
# This tell us where the class is defined and our computerâ€™s memory address where this object is stored, but no useful information for debugging our code.





# dunder method __repr__() can be used to tell Python what we want the string representation of the class to be. 
# __repr__() can only have one parameter, self, and must return a string.

class Employee():
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
 
  def __repr__(self):
    return self.name 
    # it returns the .name attribute of the object
 
argus = Employee("Argus Filch")
print(argus)
# prints "Argus Filch"
